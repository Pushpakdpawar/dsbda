      "Comment: The laptop was a great price for the horsepower.  However, I was unable to get Ubuntu 22.04 to boot up on the laptop.  I run Ubuntu Linux on all my computers and rarely have an issue installing on a new computer.  This laptop was the exception.  I attempted to install Ubuntu 22.04.  The installation went smoothly, but the system would not boot up.  It kept saying it could not find the file-system.  I then attempted to install 24.04.  Again, the installation went smoothly, but the system would not boot up.  I then attempted to install 20.04.  The installation went smoothly and this time the system did boot up.  However, when I performed the release upgrade to go from 20.04 to 22.04, the upgrade went smoothly but the system would no longer boot up.  I must have tried some 20 installations attempting different BIOS and kernel configurations before finally giving up and returning the laptop.  I ended up buying a different HP laptop from Sam's Club with which I had no problems at all installing and booting Ubuntu 22.04.If you are going to stick with the stock Microsoft Windows installation, then this laptop is probably a great buy for you.  If you intend to install a Linux installation instead, then you should avoid this laptop.\n",

The keyboard does have a bit of a grainy texture and feels plasticky on my nails, that bothers me but I'm getting used to it. Setup is a pain on windows 11, with a billion opt outs/ins for basically advertising. At least you can say no though so just pay attention to what they're asking during setup. :/Aside from that though, I'm really happy with the computer. It's fast. I turned off S mode in the settings under activation. S mode prevents you from downloading anything not Microsoft approved, including other browsers. Quite frankly, S mode is only good for controlling a child's downloads in my opinion, but I wouldn't force edge on even a child.

      "Comment: I had purchased similar laptops from another seller that came with Windows 11 Home in S mode but I didn't realize they were S mode when I bought them. When I was looking for the next batch of laptops to order, I found this one. I read the entire description and specs to make sure I wasn't ordering more laptops with S mode. This laptop was supposed to come with Windows Home 11 only. Sure enough they did have S mode.For those who don't know what S mode is, it's Microsoft's way of keeping you \"safe\" by only allowing you to download apps from the Microsoft store. That means if you want to use any other browser than Microsoft Edge, you're out of luck. There's supposed to be an easy way to switch out of S mode but the chances that it actually works is about 50/50 so if you want to use another browser like Chrome or download apps not in the Microsoft store, beware of this laptop or any that have Windows in S mode.Other than the S mode issue, these laptops are pretty decent for the price. Just know these are older, lesser laptops that have been upgraded to the advertised specs.\n",
